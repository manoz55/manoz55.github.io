Hello, and welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student at Kansas State University in the Department of Agricultural Economics under the supervision of Dr. N.B. Villoria. 

My research interest lies at the intersection of production economics, international trade, and environmental issues. 

The trade-off between food production and environmental protection is a multidimensional concern, involving the research community of many disciplinary cores. At the heart of this concern are climate change and international trade agendas, which continue to be significant drivers shaping the future of food-environment connection. This necessitates active collaboration among scientists and researchers from various disciplines, including agriculture science, economics, earth science, environmental science, data science, and more. In line with this, I intend to advance my research interests.
